  <p>Sleeping Beauty undergoes an experiment where she’s put to sleep on Sunday. Immediately after that, a fair coin is tossed. If it comes out Heads, Sleeping Beauty is waken on Monday. If it comes out Tails, she’s waken both on Monday and Tuesday. After being waken, the experimentalist asks Sleeping Beauty: <em>“What is your degree of certainty that the coin landed heads?”</em>. He subsequently puts Sleeping Beauty to sleep, taking care to administer her an amnesia inducing drug that ensures she doesn’t remember the experiment. Hence, everytime Sleeping Beauty is awaked, she won’t know which day it is or whether she has already been awakened before or not. What should her answer be?</p>

<p>It’s amazing how a simple puzzle installs chaos among mathematicians and philosophers alike. Some would argue that the correct probability is ½: after all, the coin is <strong>fair</strong>, isn’t it? Others would say that the correct probability should be ⅓. Think about this problem for a second because the correct answer is… <strong>both</strong>!</p>

<p>As many things in life, it’s all a matter of perspective. And the conundrum here lies in the way the problem is phrased. But before going into maths and probability theory, we shall <strong>simulate</strong>:</p>
